Data extracted with:
==================================================
SELECT DISTINCT (a.measurepoint_id) , c.amount
FROM kb.recording a JOIN
  (
    SELECT
      rc.measurepoint_id,
      COUNT(*) AS amount
    FROM kb.recording rc
    GROUP BY rc.measurepoint_id
    ) c ON c.measurepoint_id = a.measurepoint_id
==================================================

From the `kb' dataset.

It shows how many recordings there have been done for each measuring point.
