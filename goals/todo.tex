What features should still be extracted from the dataset.

\begin{itemize}
\item Get the distances of the pipes to the Anode, in a straight line.
\item Get the distances of the pipes to the Anode, through their own length.
\item Get the Coatings of the pipes in a area.
\item Get the ground types of an area
\item Get the (average) water level of an area or only under the pipes.
\item Get the (average) Ph level of the ground in an area or only under the pipes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

What methods should still be implemented.

\begin{itemize}
\item LVQ binning
\item LVQ sliding window and a way to get every time-step.
\item LVQ with the Linear regression as label
\item PCA
\item Suvrel
\item GML
\item Covariance Matrix
\item RGLVQ and GMLVQ, look at the matrix / vector
\item K-means
\item Neural Gas
\item Cross validation
\end{itemize}
